  This allows you to define a group of keyboard matrix outputs. Each output in the group is
  controlled by a GPIO. Each output is defined in a child node of the
  gpio-outputs node.

  Here is an example which defines three LEDs in the node /leds:

  / {
  	mtrxout {
  		compatible = "kb-mtrx-out";
  		mx_out1 {
  			gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
  		};
  		mx_out2 {
  			gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
  		};
  		mx_out3 {
  			gpios = <&gpio1 15 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
  		};
  	};
  };

  Above:

  - led_0 is pin 1 on gpio0. The LED is on when the pin is low,
    and off when the pin is high.
  - led_1 is pin 2 on gpio0. The LED is on when the pin is high,
    and off when it is low.
  - led_2 is pin 15 on gpio1. The LED is on when the pin is low,
    and the pin's internal pull-up resistor should be enabled.

compatible: "kb-mtrx-out"

        Human readable string describing the matrix output. It can be 
        used by an application to identify this keyboard matrix out 
        column or to retrieve its number/index (i.e. child node number) 
        on the parent device.
