#Keyboard Case and Plate Notes

[Jo scotto video gasket mount ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4mXZvFGHDg&t=625s)

- uses 4mm gaskets on both top and bottom  
- There is a 3.7 mm gap between the top of the plate and case, and bottom of plate and case,
despite the fact that a 4mm gasket is being used. This allows for the gasket to squish the
 board in place. 
- There is a gap between the side of the plate and the case of 0.25mm

### Dimensions of a keyboard plate and case 
- From the top of the plate to the top of the PCBs is 5.0mm <br>
- The PCB and plate (when using an FR-4 plate will both be 1.6mm) <br>
- The thickness of the hot swappable socket is 1.85mm <br>
- The switch cutout holes should be 14mm by 14mm squares
<br>
#### Total distances from top of plate to bottom of case: <br>
10.45mm = 5 (top of plate to pcb) + 1.6 (pcb) + 1.85mm (hot swap socket) + 3mm (tolerance) <br>
